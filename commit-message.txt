Fix property estimation for all address types

- Fixed logic in _get_basic_property_estimates to properly support all property types
- Improved detection and handling of commercial properties
- Ensured force_estimation parameter works correctly for all address types
- Fixed logical issue where non-multifamily properties weren't getting estimates

This change ensures that all addresses will display meaningful property data
in the frontend, properly marked as "Estimated" when real data isn't available.
