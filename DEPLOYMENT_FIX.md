# PropPulse AI Backend Fix

## Problem

The PropPulse AI app needs to provide estimated property data for ALL property types, not just multifamily addresses. Currently, the frontend displays "Not available" for many property fields when real data is missing.

## What I Changed

1. Updated the `_get_basic_property_estimates` method in `external_apis.py`:

   - Fixed logic issues when `force_estimation=True` for non-multifamily properties
   - Made the method properly detect commercial properties
   - Ensured estimation works for all property types
   - Resolved an issue where the conditional logic wasn't correctly handling all cases

2. The updated logic flow:
   - First checks if the property is multifamily (using address indicators)
   - Then checks if it's a commercial property or if estimation is forced
   - Finally provides single-family estimates if neither of the above but force_estimation is True
   - Only returns None if we can't detect property type and estimation isn't forced

## What's Already Working

- The `quick_property_analysis` endpoint in `main.py` already checks if real data is meaningful
- It already calls `_get_basic_property_estimates` with `force_estimation=True` when needed
- The frontend correctly displays the "Estimated Data" badge when data_quality.is_estimated_data is True

## How to Deploy

1. Push the updated code to GitHub (which you mentioned is already connected to Railway)
2. The Railway deployment should automatically update
3. Verify that the frontend now shows estimated data for ALL property types

## Testing Instructions

1. Test the app with different address types: single-family, commercial, and multifamily
2. Confirm that property data is shown (either real or estimated) for all addresses
3. Verify that the "Estimated Data" badge appears when data is estimated

The key issue was in the logic flow of the estimation method. The updated code now properly handles all property types and applies the force_estimation parameter correctly.
